This project provided me an opportunity to build something with AI assistance. Check out my [AI Usage Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1univ-FQUIos0QFay0x51Kzq6KWVPm9jPJ3LcxInUtyc/edit?usp=sharing) to see how I used AI on this project.

## Share one technical concept that you developed greater mastery over in this project. Demonstrate how you understand that concept by sharing your mental model of the concept. Then, show how you used that concept in your project.

One technical concept I developed greater mastery over in this project is CSS transitions and box-shadow. My mental model of transitions is that they control how a change happens over time, not the change itself — they smoothly animate properties like color, position, or shadow when a state changes (such as :hover). Box-shadow, in turn, helps create visual depth, making elements feel interactive and layered rather than flat.

I applied this concept in my project by adding subtle hover effects to interactive elements. For example, I used transitions to smoothly change border color and move elements slightly upward on hover, paired with a soft box-shadow to give the illusion that the element is lifting off the page. This made the UI feel more responsive and polished while reinforcing clear visual feedback for users.

## Choose one project requirement that you found challenging and are proud of implementing. Describe what made it challenging and how you were able to implement the requirement by walking through your code as succinctly as possible. Remember that your audience does not know your code nearly as well as you do so you’ll have to break it down in a logical manner for them to quickly understand it.

One project requirement I found **challenging**—but am proud of implementing—was using Flexbox and CSS Grid together, while also making the navigation bar sticky. The main challenge was deciding which layout system to use for which elements, since Flexbox and Grid solve different problems. I had to think carefully about the structure of the page instead of applying layout rules randomly.

I used Flexbox for one-dimensional layouts like the navigation bar, where items needed to align horizontally and stay evenly spaced. For the product section, I switched to CSS Grid because it handled two-dimensional layouts better, allowing me to control rows, columns, and responsive breakpoints cleanly. To make the navigation sticky, I applied position: sticky with a top value and ensured its parent didn’t block it, so it stayed visible while scrolling. Breaking the layout into logical sections and choosing the right tool for each one helped me implement this requirement successfully.

## How did you leverage AI to assist your development of this project?

I leveraged AI as a learning and **debugging tool** throughout the development of this project. When I got stuck on concepts like CSS transitions, box shadows, Flexbox, and Grid, I used AI to help clarify why something wasn’t working instead of just copying solutions. This helped me build a mental model of how layout and animations behave in the browser.

I also used AI to quickly test ideas, such as refining hover effects, adjusting colors, and troubleshooting small syntax issues that were blocking my progress. Rather than replacing my thinking, AI helped speed up my learning process and allowed me to iterate more confidently while still making intentional design and coding decisions.
